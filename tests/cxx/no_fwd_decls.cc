// Test that passing the --no_fwd_decls switch to IWYU suggests including the
// corresponding header file even when the use is not a full use.
//
// The normal IWYU policy is to minimize the number of #include directives
// without introducing unnecessary coupling.

// The --no_fwd_decls policy is to minimize the number of redeclarations to
// avoid over-loose coupling, which might lead to errors and busy-work when a
// type eventually changes.
